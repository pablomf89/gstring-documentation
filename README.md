## Welcome to Gstring
### Step 1: Download the npm package
Open a terminal window and navigate to your React project directory.

Install the gstring library from npm by running the following command: npm install gstring

Import the gstring library into your React component where you want to use it by adding the following line at the top of your file: import gstring from 'gstring';

Use the gstring library in your React component by calling its methods and passing any required arguments. For example, if gstring has a method called baz that takes a string as an argument, you can use it like this: gstring.baz('Hello, world!')

Once you have finished using the gstring library in your React component, you can save your changes and test them by running your React app.

### Step 2. Take a look to the gstring features
Home
Global elements
Forms
Form wizard
Messages
Modals
Buttons
Wysiwyg

### Step 3. Copy the examples and start using it
To use the examples from gstring in your React project, you will first need to install the gstring library and its dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install gstring
Once the gstring library is installed, you can import the individual components that you want to use in your React component files. For example, to use the Button component from gstring, you would import it like this:

import Button from 'react-gstring/Button';
You can then use the Button component in your React components by using the <Button> JSX tag. For example:

<Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
In addition to importing the individual components that you want to use, you will also need to include the gstring CSS styles in your project. This can be done by importing the gstring CSS file in the entry point of your app, such as the index.js file.

import 'gstring/dist/css/gstring.min.css';
After importing the gstring CSS, you should be able to use the gstring components and styles in your React project. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
